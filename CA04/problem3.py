# CA04 Problem3

# Write a program which prints the multiplication table of a given number (stop at 10).
# Sample input: n=2
# Sample output: 2x1 = 1, 2x2 = 4, 2x3 = 6, 2x4 = 8, 2x5 = 10 ... 2x10 = 20

number = int(input("Please enter a number: "))

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{number} * {i} = ", int(number) * i)
